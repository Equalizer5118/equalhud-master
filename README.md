# equalhud-master
Repository for my custom TF2 hud.

Hi there! This is the development branch of my TF2 Hud! Every change I make I will push to here. When I find that a build is good enough for release, I will push it to the release branch. All content in this branch is subject to change and can also be incredibly unstable. Do not be suprised if multiple, or all, features are broken. If you have feedback or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me! My email is: 
thedoomslayer1574@outlook.com (i just needed a name and I didn't care).

Hud main release branch: <https://github.com/Equalizer5118/equalhud-master/> <br>
Dev branch: <https://github.com/Equalizer5118/equalhud-master/tree/dev> (all files downloaded from the developer branch are subject to instability.)
